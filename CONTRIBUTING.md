# Contributing

This document outlines the process for contributing to the `sme-web` repository.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any unnecessary install, development, debugging or build dependencies are removed
2. Update the relevant documents ([README.md](/README.md), [docs](/docs), etc...) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters
3. You may merge (`Squash & Merge` unless there's a valid reason not to) the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you

## Coding standards

Reading and understanding all stuff in [docs](/docs) would be beneficial
If you can't read all the docs for some reasons, make sure you're at least familiar with the [coding-standards](/docs/coding-standards.md) before proceeding
